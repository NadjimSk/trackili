            <h2>2) What we collect and why (and the legal basis)</h2>

            <p><strong>Account data (required):</strong> your <strong>email</strong> (required for sign-up and sign-in),
                your <strong>Firebase user ID (UID)</strong>, a <strong>display name/username</strong> (required — you
                can choose any name), and
                <strong>session tokens (JWT)</strong> used to authenticate requests.<br />
                If you sign in with <strong>Google</strong>, we also receive your <strong>Google display name</strong>
                and
                <strong>profile photo URL</strong> to populate your in-app profile (we do not modify your Google
                account).<br />
                <em>Purpose:</em> create and manage your account, sign you in, secure your session, support
                communications, and confirm sensitive requests (e.g., account deletion).<br />
                <em>Legal basis:</em> Contract performance (Art. 6(1)(b)).
            </p>

            <hr class="divider" />

            <p><strong>Parcel tracking numbers:</strong> the shipment numbers you add to view status and updates.<br />
                <em>Purpose:</em> fetch and display your shipment status, and help you restore your list when changing
                devices.<br />
                <em>Legal basis:</em> Contract performance.
            </p>

            <hr class="divider" />

            <p><strong>User preferences:</strong> language, notification settings (opt-in/opt-out), country/currency to
                display regional prices for AliExpress.<br />
                <em>Purpose:</em> customize your experience.<br />
                <em>Legal basis:</em> Contract performance / Legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f)), as applicable.

            <hr class="divider" />

            <p><strong>Diagnostics &amp; performance (Firebase Crashlytics and Firebase Analytics):</strong><br />
                Technical information such as Android version, device model, app version/build, crash logs and stack
                traces, and aggregated usage metrics.
                These diagnostics are <strong>essential for stability and safety and cannot be disabled from within the
                    app</strong>.
                We do <strong>not</strong> use this data for behavioral advertising and we do <strong>not</strong>
                collect precise location.<br />
                <em>Purpose:</em> detect/fix issues, improve stability, security, and quality.<br />
                <em>Legal basis:</em> Legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f)). If you do not agree with these diagnostics,
                please refrain from using the app; if you already have an account, you may delete it (see Section 6).
                Previously collected crash data may remain for the limited retention period managed by Firebase.
            </p>

            <hr class="divider" />

            <p><strong>Push notification tokens (FCM):</strong> a device token generated by Firebase Cloud
                Messaging.<br />
                <em>Purpose:</em> send the notifications you enable (e.g., parcel progress, deals).<br />
                <em>Legal basis:</em> Consent (withdrawable at any time in the app or device settings).<br />
                <em>Your control:</em> you can withdraw consent at any time in the in-app settings or your device
                settings. We stop sending notifications and <strong>delete your FCM token</strong> when you disable
                notifications or delete your account.
            </p>

            <hr class="divider" />

            <p><strong>Advertising identifiers:</strong> We <strong>do not use</strong> the Android Advertising ID, and
                we do <strong>not</strong> link it to FCM or other features.</p>

            <hr class="divider" />

            <p><strong>Support communications:</strong> the content of your messages and your contact details when you
                contact us.<br />
                <em>Purpose:</em> respond to your requests and improve the service.<br />
                <em>Legal basis:</em> Contract performance / Legitimate interests.
            </p>

            <p><strong>We do NOT collect:</strong> full legal name, postal address, phone number, payment information,
                precise location, or access to camera/microphone/contacts for tracking purposes.</p>

            <hr class="divider" />

            <p><strong>Plain-language notice:</strong><br />
                Using the app <strong>requires an email address</strong> for sign-in. If you prefer not to share this or
                disagree with the data practices described above, you may choose not to use the app. If you already have
                an account, you can <strong>delete it at any time</strong> (see <a href="#retention">Section 6</a>).

            <h2>3) How we use your data</h2>

            <p><strong>Account &amp; authentication</strong><br />
                We use your email, Firebase UID, and session tokens (JWT) to create and operate your account, sign you
                in, and keep your session secure (e.g., preventing unauthorized access).<br />
                <em>Legal basis:</em> Contract performance (Art. 6(1)(b)).
            </p>

            <p><strong>Parcel tracking</strong><br />
                We process the tracking numbers you add to query shipping providers and show you the latest shipment
                status. We keep your list available so you can restore it when moving to a new device.<br />
                <em>Legal basis:</em> Contract performance.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Preferences &amp; personalization (non-sensitive)</strong><br />
                We apply your language, notification opt-in/out, and country/currency settings to tailor the UI and
                display regional prices where applicable.<br />
                <em>Legal basis:</em> Contract performance / Legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f)).
            </p>

            <p><strong>Notifications (FCM)</strong><br />
                If you opt in, we use your FCM device token to send the categories you enabled (e.g., parcel progress,
                deals). You can turn notifications off at any time in the app or device settings; when you do, we stop
                sending notifications and <strong>delete the FCM token</strong>. We do <strong>not</strong> link
                notifications to the Android Advertising ID.<br />
                <em>Legal basis:</em> Consent.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Diagnostics &amp; performance (Firebase Crashlytics &amp; Firebase Analytics)</strong><br />
                We use crash reports, stack traces, app version/build, device model/OS version, and aggregated usage
                metrics <strong>solely</strong> to detect/fix issues and improve stability and security. These
                diagnostics are <strong>essential</strong> to the service and <strong>cannot be disabled from within the
                    app</strong>. We do <strong>not</strong> use them for behavioral advertising and we do
                <strong>not</strong> collect precise location.<br />
                <strong>Where processed:</strong> exclusively in Firebase (we do not export raw analytics/crash events
                to our own database; we view aggregated dashboards only).<br />
                <em>Legal basis:</em> Legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f)). If you do not agree with these diagnostics,
                please refrain from using the app; if you already have an account, you may delete it (see Section 6).
            </p>

            <p><strong>Affiliate links &amp; external content</strong><br />
                We may show affiliate banners/links and product details fetched from external providers. Clicking a link
                opens the third party’s site/app, where their terms and privacy policy apply. We do <strong>not</strong>
                sell your data.
            </p>

            <h3>What we <strong>do not</strong> do</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>We do <strong>not</strong> store or maintain server-side behavioral profiles (e.g., clickstream
                    histories) tied to your identity.</li>
                <li>We do <strong>not</strong> use behavioral or personalized ads.</li>
                <li>We do <strong>not</strong> sell personal data or share it with data brokers.</li>
                <li>We do <strong>not</strong> allow user-generated content or user-to-user communication inside the
                    app.</li>
                <li>We do <strong>not</strong> request precise location, camera, microphone, or contacts for tracking
                    purposes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Limited operational logs (server-side)</h3>
            <p>Our backend may generate <strong>temporary operational logs</strong> (e.g., error traces, request IDs,
                abuse/rate-limit events) <strong>only</strong> to troubleshoot incidents, ensure security, and operate
                the service. These logs are <strong>rotated and minimized</strong>, are <strong>not</strong> used to
                build profiles, and are kept separate from Firebase analytics/crash data.</p>

            <h2>4) Sharing with trusted parties (processors / recipients)</h2>

            <p><em>Terminology:</em> <strong>Processors</strong> act on our behalf to provide app functionality.
                <strong>Recipients (independent controllers)</strong> are third parties you visit or whose content you
                access; their own policies apply.

                            and <strong>aggregated usage metrics</strong> strictly for diagnostics and performance. We

                    <strong>do not</strong> send your email, name, or identifiers. Returned statuses are displayed and
                    may be cached briefly for performance.

                <li><strong>Price/deals providers (Recipients) — e.g., AliExpress APIs:</strong> we use <strong>product

                    details/prices. We <strong>do not</strong> send your personal data to these providers. If you open a

            <h2>5) Ads &amp; affiliate links</h2>

            <p><strong>No ad SDKs / no behavioral ads.</strong><br />
                The app does <strong>not</strong> integrate third-party ad SDKs (e.g., AdMob) and does

            <p><strong>Affiliate disclosures.</strong><br />
                We may display <strong>affiliate banners/links</strong> to third-party products or stores. If you

                Prices and availability are set by the third party; please verify the final price and terms at checkout.

            <p><strong>Data sharing for affiliates.</strong><br />
                We do <strong>not</strong> share your personal data (e.g., email, UID) with affiliate partners. Links
                may include <strong>standard referral parameters</strong> so the partner can attribute a purchase. We do
                <strong>not</strong> track your browsing on third-party sites/apps.

            <p><strong>Changes.</strong><br />
                If we later introduce an ad SDK or personalized ads, we will update this policy and our Google Play Data

            <p><strong>General principle.</strong><br />
                We retain personal data <strong>only for as long as necessary</strong> to provide the service and
                fulfill the purposes set out in this policy. When data is no longer needed, we delete it from our

            <p><strong>Account, tracking numbers, preferences, and FCM token.</strong><br />
                Kept while your account is active. When you delete your account, we delete:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>your account record (email, UID, display name),</li>

                request IDs) strictly for troubleshooting, security, and abuse prevention. These logs are rotated on a
                short cycle, kept separate from analytics/crash data, and are <strong>not</strong> used to build
                behavioral profiles.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Backups.</strong><br />
                If system backups exist, deleted items are removed through the <strong>routine backup rotation
                    cycle</strong>. Backups are <strong>not</strong> used to restore individually deleted data.

            <h3>Account &amp; data deletion</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>In-app:</strong> <em>Settings → Delete Account</em> (removes your data from our operational
                    systems without undue delay).</li>
                <li><strong>Account deletion assistance:</strong> If you are unable to delete your account from within
                    the app, you may submit a request via our support page: <a
                        href="https://www.trackili.app/terms/delete-account.html"
                        rel="noopener">https://www.trackili.app/terms/delete-account.html</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Scope:</strong> deleting your account removes your account data, tracking numbers,
                    preferences, and FCM token from our operational systems. Diagnostics previously sent to Firebase may
                    persist until Firebase’s retention period ends.</li>
                <li><strong>Identity verification:</strong> we may request reasonable information to verify that the
                    deletion request is made by the account owner.</li>

            <h2>14) Disclaimer (important)</h2>

            <p><strong>Nature of the service.</strong> Trackili is <strong>not</strong> a shipping carrier, logistics
                provider, payment processor, or online store. We do <strong>not</strong> generate tracking data and we
                do <strong>not</strong> fulfill, ship, or sell products. The app aggregates and displays information
                obtained from external providers for your convenience.</p>
            <p><strong>Source &amp; accuracy of information.</strong> Shipment statuses, product details, prices, and
                deals are provided by third-party services and may be delayed, incomplete, or inconsistent across
                systems. Information is shown “as is / as available.” We do not guarantee accuracy, completeness, or
                timeliness, and we may cache data briefly for performance.</p>
            <p><strong>Prices, availability, and terms.</strong> Prices, taxes, shipping costs, availability, delivery
                estimates, and seller terms are set by the third party and may change at any time without notice. Before
                purchasing, verify the final price, taxes/fees, shipping, and seller terms at checkout.</p>
            <p><strong>No endorsement / no party to transactions.</strong> Links (including affiliate links) are for
                convenience only. We do not endorse sellers/products and we are not a party to your transactions. For
                order/refund/warranty/shipping issues, contact the merchant/seller or carrier directly.</p>
            <p><strong>Service availability &amp; dependencies.</strong> Our service depends on third-party APIs and
                infrastructure (e.g., carriers, marketplaces, Firebase). We do not warrant uninterrupted availability
                and may modify, suspend, or discontinue features at any time.</p>
            <p><strong>Limitation of liability.</strong> To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for
                indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or for loss arising from reliance on
                third-party information, service interruptions, delays, customs/duty assessments, or issues outside our
                reasonable control. Nothing limits liability where it cannot be limited under applicable law (e.g.,
                fraud).</p>
            <p><strong>Your responsibility.</strong> Always verify shipment status with your carrier and final
